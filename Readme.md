# 3D Gaussian Splatting VR Editor

This is a virtual reality (VR) editor for inspecting and cleaning 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models by selecting and removing floating artifacts. The tool provides intuitive 3D navigation, brush-based volumetric selection, and real-time manipulation of splats within a VR environment.

### Overview
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering for 3D reconstruction using Gaussian ellipsoids. While powerful, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts due to motion, lighting inconsistency, or occlusions. This VR tool allows users to:

- Navigate 3DGS models in VR  
- Select and delete floating splats using a volumetric brush  
- Adjust splat size 
- Insert/delete Cutboxes during runtime.
